# FIJI-Macro-to-detect-calbindin-spheroids-or-foci-or-puncta-
This FIJI Macro was made for the purpose of quantifying calbindin-positive spheroids in the cerebellar region of an autophagy mouse model. 

Example images are provided in the folder to try the macro out in FIJI. 

Macro can be tuned/adapted for detecting spherical structures on other images in other contexts (for example synapses, foci, or puncta)
